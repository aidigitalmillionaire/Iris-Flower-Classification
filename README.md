# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification project built in Google Colab using Scikit-learn. Trains and evaluates multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM) to classify Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) with visualization and performance comparison.

# ðŸ“Œ Project Description â€” Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project implements Iris Flower Classification using Scikit-learn in Google Colab.
The classic Iris dataset (150 samples, 3 classes) is used to build and evaluate machine learning models that predict the flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) from sepal and petal measurements.
