# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification project built in Google Colab using Scikit-learn. Trains and evaluates multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM) to classify Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) with visualization and performance comparison.

# 📌 Project Description — Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project implements Iris Flower Classification using Scikit-learn in Google Colab.
The classic Iris dataset (150 samples, 3 classes) is used to build and evaluate machine learning models that predict the flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) from sepal and petal measurements.

# 🔑 Key Features

Clean, annotated Google Colab notebook for end-to-end workflow

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Supervised ML models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, and SVM

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Easy to reproduce — runs fully in Google Colab with no setup needed

# 🎯 Applications

Introductory project for machine learning beginners

Demonstrates classification pipeline from raw data to evaluation

Template for small dataset classification problems
